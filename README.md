# CTCI
I am working my way though the problems in the (in)famous Cracking the Coding Interview book and I am posting my solutions in C++. These are merely statements of facts in the computer science field and I am in no way sharing copyright material to any third party for material benefit. My aim is to purely document the process and to further my own personal education.

Enjoy.
